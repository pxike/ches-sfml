# ches-sfml
chess implementation in sfml cuz i wanna learn c++
# missing stuff 
this was a 15h binge coding and i hate everything about it now . probably won't touch it for a while.
ah forgot to add special moves like castle and promotions , alongside reverting moves , i figured that would need me to remake the whole thing , who could hav guessed design patterns would have been a great thing to consider when writting this 
# was fun atleast ,i hope some c++ God could drop some wisdom for this project
